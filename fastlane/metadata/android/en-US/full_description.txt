    <li>
        <p>For devices support wifi adb or rooted, <code>Shizuku</code> is
            recommend. <a href="https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku">About Shizuku</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For rooted devices, <code>Superuser</code> is alternative. <strong>It is slower.</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Select <code>Device Owner</code> otherwise. <strong>It's a pain to set up.</strong></p>
